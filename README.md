This is a multiplayer online game that uses Google Firebase. Two players / browsers are needed to begin.

Each player should login by entering their name in the first box and clicking the Start button. Once both players have joined, the game can start. Player 1 will then be prompted to choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors. After player 1 is done, player 2 gets to choose, and so on. The game score is displayed for both players. There is also a chat window for the players to communicate during the game.
